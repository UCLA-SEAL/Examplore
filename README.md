# Examplore
Visualizing API Usage Examples at Scale (CHI 2018)

## Summary of Examplore 
abstract = {Using existing APIs properly is a key challenge in programming, given that libraries
and APIs are increasing in number and complexity. Programmers often search for online
code examples in Q&amp;A forums and read tutorials and blog posts to learn how to use
a given API. However, there are often a massive number of related code examples and
it is difficult for a user to understand the commonalities and variances among them,
while being able to drill down to concrete details. We introduce an interactive visualization
for exploring a large collection of code examples mined from open-source repositories
at scale. This visualization summarizes hundreds of code examples in one synthetic
code skeleton with statistical distributions for canonicalized statements and structures
enclosing an API call. We implemented this interactive visualization for a set of
Java APIs and found that, in a lab study, it helped users (1) answer significantly
more API usage questions correctly and comprehensively and (2) explore how other programmers
have used an unfamiliar API.},
